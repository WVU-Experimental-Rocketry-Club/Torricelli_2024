## 1. Install and configure git

 Git is used as the main method of syncing/sharing documentation and progress. 
1. Make a git account
2. Install git on your computer. (on mac/linux can be done on the cmd, on windows needs an installer)
3. generate ssh-keys: `ssh-key-gen` press enter all the way. this will make a rsa key typically inside `~/.ssh`
4. add the ssh key to your git account. `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` copy paste to your profile.
5. clone the repo using the ssh link:`git@github.com:WVU-Experimental-Rocketry-Club/Torricelli_2024.git`
## 2. Configure Obsidian-md

- Obsidian-md is a free text based note taking system and is been used to make the documentation easy.
- Download and install Obsidian-md [here](https://obsidian.md).  
- open the cloned directory and most of the configuration needed would be done for you
